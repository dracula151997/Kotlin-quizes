### Quiz:
1. **What is a primary use of data classes in Kotlin?**
   - A) To hold UI components
   - B) To manage data with automatically generated functions
   - C) To handle network requests

2. **Which of the following functions is *not* automatically generated for a data class?**
   - A) `equals()`
   - B) `hashCode()`
   - C) `calculate()`

3. **True or False:** Data classes in Kotlin can be abstract.

4. **If a data class has a property not in the primary constructor, is it included in `equals()` comparisons?**
   - A) Yes
   - B) No

5. **What does the `copy()` function do in a data class?**
   - A) Duplicates the object, allowing for modifications in specific properties
   - B) Copies values to another data structure
   - C) Clones the entire application state

6. **Which of the following is a requirement for creating a data class in Kotlin?**
   - A) It must have at least one primary constructor parameter.
   - B) It must extend another class.
   - C) It cannot have properties.

7. **In Kotlin, how do data classes handle `equals()` and `hashCode()` functions by default?**
   - A) They do not include these functions.
   - B) They include both, comparing properties listed in the primary constructor.
   - C) Only `hashCode()` is generated by default.

8. **True or False:** Data classes in Kotlin automatically provide a `toString()` method based on their primary constructor properties.

9. **Can data classes contain mutable properties (using `var`)?**
   - A) Yes
   - B) No

10. **What will happen if you declare a property outside of the primary constructor in a data class?**
    - A) It will not be included in `toString`, `equals`, `hashCode`, or `copy`.
    - B) It will be included in all generated functions.
    - C) It will generate an error during compilation.

### Code Quiz:
1. **Create a data class `User` with properties `name` (String) and `email` (String).** 
   - Initialize it with `name = "Alice"` and `email = "alice@example.com"` and print its `toString()`.

2. **Given the following data class:**
   ```kotlin
   data class Product(val id: Int, val name: String)
   ```
   What would be the output of the following code?
   ```kotlin
   val prod1 = Product(1, "Laptop")
   val prod2 = Product(1, "Laptop")
   println(prod1 == prod2)
   ```

3. **Using `copy()`, create a copy of `User` with a new email value of `bob@example.com` and print it.**

4. **Write a data class `Rectangle` with `width` and `height`.**
   - Calculate and print the area in a `calculateArea()` function.

5. **Create a data class `Book` with properties `title`, `author`, and `price` (Double).** 
   - Use `copy()` to create a new book with a discounted price (e.g., 20% off).

6. **Using destructuring, access the properties of an instance of `User` created in question 1 and print them individually.**

7. **Given a data class `Order(val id: Int, val amount: Double)`, create two `Order` objects with the same id and amount.** 
   - Compare them and print whether they are equal or not.

8. **Write a data class `Point` with `x` and `y` coordinates.**
   - Add a function `distanceToOrigin()` that calculates and prints the distance from the origin `(0,0)`.

9. **Define a data class `Employee` with `firstName`, `lastName`, and `salary`.** 
   - Add a function `giveRaise(percent: Double)` to increase the salary by a certain percentage.

10. **Using `copy()`, create a modified instance of `Employee` from question 9, changing only the last name.**

### Code Challenge:
Implement a data class `Person` with properties `firstName` and `lastName`, and an optional property `age` set to 0 by default. Write a function that:
1. Creates an instance of `Person`.
2. Creates a modified copy of the `Person` instance with a different age.
3. Uses destructuring to print the first name and age of the copied instance.

**Example output**:
```
Original: Person(firstName=Jane, lastName=Doe, age=0)
Modified: Person(firstName=Jane, lastName=Doe, age=25)
Destructured: Jane, 25
```
